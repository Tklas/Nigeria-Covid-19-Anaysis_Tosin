These dataset contains the different states affected by covid-19 which is represented by unique ID's , The date the patient was detected with the symptoms, The number of confirmed cases, new cases and death cases, The % global new cases, confirmed cases and death cases, The weather in celcius degree at the time the person was detected, the buying rate, central rate and selling rate for the covid 19 protection kit/vaccine.


Recommendations

I recommend that instead of having the states represented with unique ID's,  The names of each affected state should be clearly stated out that way anyone looking into the dataset can know what states in the country are affected. also the unique ID's can be used for the persons who have contracted the covid-19 

 The analysis helps us see that Nigeria is one of the countries that has less cases as compared to the percentage of global cases all over the globe. the death rate is very low as compared to the global number of deaths.
 
These dataset contains only cases within the first quater of the year 2023 hence having a full information starting from the period where the covid 19 first came into the scene in Nigeria would be more elaborate and one can have a comprehensive report of all the cases and the sum total number of people that were affected.
